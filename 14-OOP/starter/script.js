//! What is Object-Oriented Programming

// We use objects to model real world or abstract features

// Objects may contain data (Properties) and code (Methods)

// By using objects, we pack data and corresponding behavior into one block

// OOP objects are self-contained pieces/blocks of code
// They are used as building blocks for applications and interact with one another
// These interactions happen through an API: methods that the code outside of the object can access and use to communicate with the object

// A Class is like a blueprint from which we create new objects

//! The Four Principles of OOP

//! 1. Abstraction
/* Ignoring or Hiding details that don't matter, allowing for an overview perspective of what we are
implementing, instead of messing with details that do not matter.

//! 2. Encapsulation
/* Keep certain properties and methods private inside the class, so they are not accessible outside it.
Some Methods can be exposed as a public interface (API)

//! 3. Inheritance
/* Makes all properties and methods of a certain class available to a child class.
This forms a hierarchal relationship between classes.  This allows us to reuse common logic and
to model real-world relationships.

//! 4. Polymorphism
/* A child class can overwrite a method it inherited from a parent class. */
